# TGM Documentation

TGM is a research library designed to accelerate training workloads over dynamic graphs and facilitate prototyping of temporal graph learning methods.

Our main goal is to provide an efficient abstraction over dynamic graphs to enable new practitioners to quickly contribute to research in the field. We natively support both discrete and continuous-time graphs.

## Installation

```sh
pip install tgm-lib
```
